Much of the information and many of the programs a company needs to run are now stored in the cloud: they aren’t saved or used on just one computer, but on many connected computers (the “cloud”) and can only be used by a computer when it connects to that network. Cloud Engineers design and build the network that holds this information. They also make sure that other computers can use this information.
