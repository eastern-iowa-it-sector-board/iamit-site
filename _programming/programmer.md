Programmers do what coders do but write instructions (or code) that are often more complicated and complete. Coders may write some of the instructions for an app, but programmers make sure that whole app works and can talk to other apps or programs. They may need more knowledge of math and formulas in order to write instructions that repeat or interact with information in a complex way.
