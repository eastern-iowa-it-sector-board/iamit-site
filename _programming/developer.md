Developers must also be able to write instructions (or code) for programs, websites, and computers. However, programmers and coders often work on one app or program using one kind of programming language. Developers use many languages to make sure that apps and programs talk to each other. Because they work with many different apps or programs, developers must also be able to talk and plan with other programmers and coders.
