Rather than working as employees of organization, Entrepreneurs run businesses by taking on more risk than a typical employee, and in turn, receiving more rewards when the organization does well. Because entrepreneurs often create a new business, their education backgrounds are not as defined as those in traditional leadership roles. Further, their salary largely depends on how well an organization performs.
